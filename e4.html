        <h2>Something About Me</h2>
        <p>The giant panda is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and
            rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring
            musteloid</p> <br>
        <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the
            French word panda has been found.The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to
            the adapted wrist .</p> <br>
            <h2>Behaviour</h2>

        <p>It has been estimated that an adult panda absorbs 54.8–66.1 mg (0.846–1.020 gr) of cyanide a day through its
            diet. To prevent poisoning, they have evolved anti-toxic mechanisms to protect themselves. About 80% of the
            cyanide is metabolized to less toxic thiocyanate and discharged in urine, while the remaining 20% is
            detoxified by other minor pathways </p>
